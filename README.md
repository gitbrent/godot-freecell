## üì± Exporting to iOS

Exporting FreeCell Solitaire to iOS is straightforward, requiring only Xcode, Apple‚Äôs integrated development environment. You do not need an Apple Developer license to sideload the game onto your own device for personal use. Here‚Äôs how you can get your game running on an iOS device:

### Prerequisites

- **Xcode:** Ensure you have the latest version of Xcode installed on your Mac. You can download it for free from the [Mac App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835).
- **Godot Export Templates:** Download and install the export templates for iOS from within the Godot Engine. This can be done by going to `Editor` > `Manage Export Templates` in the Godot Engine menu.

### Steps

1. **Export Project in Godot:**
   - Open your project in Godot Engine.
   - Go to `Project` > `Export` and select `Add‚Ä¶` to add a new export preset.
   - Choose `iOS` from the list and configure the export settings as needed. For most cases, the default settings will suffice.
   - Click `Export Project`, choose a destination, and save your `.ipa` file.

2. **Sideloading with Xcode:**
   - Open Xcode and navigate to `File` > `Open` to open the `.ipa` file you exported.
   - Connect your iOS device to your Mac via USB.
   - Select your device from the list of available targets in Xcode.
   - Navigate to `Window` > `Devices and Simulators`, and under the ‚ÄúInstalled Apps‚Äù section, drag and drop your `.ipa` file to install the game on your device.

3. **Trust Developer App:**
   - On your iOS device, go to `Settings` > `General` > `Device Management`.
   - Under "Developer App", tap your Apple ID and then trust it.
   - You should now be able to open the game on your device.

### Notes

- While you don't need an Apple Developer account for personal use, distributing your game on the App Store or to a broader audience requires a membership in the Apple Developer Program.
- Sideloading with Xcode installs the game only on connected devices and is ideal for testing or personal use.
- Remember to check the [official Godot documentation](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/getting_started/workflow/export/exporting_for_ios.html) for any updates or changes to the export process.

With these steps, you can enjoy FreeCell Solitaire on your iOS device without any cost. Happy gaming!
